# TypeScript Playground

A playground for TypeScript with the [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor).

## Play

See the playground in action: https://fabiandev.github.io/typescript-playground

> A shareable URL can be obtained from the settings of the editor.

## Compiler Options

The playground supports some compiler options out of the box. Anyway, a property `tsp` is exposed to the global `window` object, where it is possible to set any option not supported by the UI:

```js
tsp.setCompilerOption('emitDecoratorMetadata', true);
```

## Console API

Besides setting compiler options via `setCompilerOption`, the editor exposes some more functionality:

| Property              | Description
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------
| options               | Holds all options of the editor, including compiler options
| sync()                | Syncs (changed) options with the editor
| emit()                | Triggers a compilation
| run()                 | Runs the compiled code in a window
| share()               | Retrieves a shareable URL as string
| reset(reload = false) | Resets the editor and optionally reloads the page

### Build

To start a build, run `yarn build`.
